# Adzy's Radial Menu

A simple radial menu for GMod, simply pass in items and click or release to select. I need to thank _Lucas for the drawing arc code I used:

## TODO

- Define some format that you pass things in with that can be used universally.
- Add selection logic.
- Add better menuing for items, things like flavour text on hover.
- Lots of config stuff like desired button, etc.

## Thanks
- Thank you to Lucas for the [QuickSelect addon code](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841867853) which helped me draw nice smooth radial menus.
- Thank you to Swampservers for the [autoicons code](https://github.com/swampservers/autoicons/tree/master) which made 3D2D rendering in GMod actually easy to work with.
